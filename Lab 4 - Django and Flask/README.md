# Lab 4 -- Django and Flask
For this lab, we were to demonstrate the usage of Django and Flask to set up servers and view apps.

The instructions for this lab can be found at [2022-02-22 Lesson 4: Structuring the Search for a Solution](https://goo.gl/5o3d2k). The picture of these instructions (seen below) was also taken from that presentation. In addition, the more in-depth lab instructions and the Python programs used can be found in the [lesson4](./lesson4) directory and were taken from Professor Kevin Lu's [iot directory](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson4)
